<h2>What religion do Vikings follow? </h2>
<p>Vikings follow Norse mythology. Norse mythology is the collection of myths of the North
Germanic people. Vikings believe that the world is made up of 9 different realms.
The gods had a huge battle with their enemies and as a result, these realms were born.
The vikings worship the Nordic gods and live in the realm of "Midgard."
</p>

<h2>What are the different realms?</h2>
<p>Vikings believe that the world is on a huge tree called Yggdrasil.
It is made up of 9 different realms, all located on different parts of the world tree. 
They are Niflheim, Muspelheim, Asgard, Midgard, Jotunheim, Vanaheim, Alfheim, 
Svartalfheim, and Helheim respectively. Each realm has different people, terrain, and
weather.
</p>

<h2> What is Valhalla? </h2>
<p>Valhalla is a huge majestic hall in the realm of the gods, "Asgard." From those who
die in combat, the leader of the gods, Odin chooses which warriors get to enter Valhalla.
Valhalla is seen as a huge blessing by the Vikings. This urges them to enter battle and 
fight till their last. Odin only chooses the strongest warriors. Hence, Vikings would gladly
enter battles and raids without fearing death.
