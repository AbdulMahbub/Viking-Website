<h2 id="minisword">Swords</h2>
<p>Swords were the most expensive weapon for the vikings because it took the most iron to make.
They were often decorated and had crude names such as "Arm-ripper" or "Head-hunter." Vikings carried 
swords in scabbards worn over the shoulder and always kept them accessible to the right hand. 
</p>

<h2 id="miniaxe"> Axes</h2>
<p>Axes were used by the vikings as deadly projectiles that they could throw or chop
down foes with. Just as swords, axe heads were also richly decorated with gold and silver.
Some axes had small cutting edges but others were up to 18 inches long! 
</p>

<h2 id="minispear">Spears</h2>
<p>Spears were the most common weapon used in battle by the vikings. They took the least
iron to make and could be thrown or thrust at the enemy. Spear heads came in many different
sizes but just like the other weapons they too were decorated.</p>
